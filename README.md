# Sansar
C# Code for Project Sansar

This code is all written to be used in modular scripting using Simple Script and Reflex Script integration.  These scripts add to the Simple Scripts published by Linden Labs and the Reflex Scripts published by Metaverse Machines.  These scripts are all demoed in Sansar at the **Scripts Institute** Experience.

**Action Instrument** - a playable musical instrument script.

**Logic Sequence Checker** = a script that checks if a stream of inputs match a certain sequence.  Can be used as a pass code or password checking mechanism.

**Logic Sequence Player** - sends a series of outputs based a on a sequence you set.  Can be used to control music, lights, movement, etc.

**Piano Sample Pack1V2** - defines music instruments for StandAloneInstrument.

**ReflexStrobeKight** - strobe light for Sansar using Reflex Framework.

**Trigger Complex Interaction** - this allows you to use a sinlge model with logical circular control surfaces to send messages based on the control surface that was interacted with.

**Trigger Complex Interaction Rectangle** - this allows you to use a single model with rectangular control surfaces to send messages based on the control surface that was interacted with.

**Trigger Key Pressed2** - maps 40 keys from the PC Keyboard (10 number keys across top of keyboard, 10 keypad numbers, Shift key plus the 10 number keys across top of keyboard, Shift key plus the 10 keypad numbers) to send messages.

**Trigger Proximity Detector** - detects if an avatar is within a certain range of the object the script is placed in.  Sends a message when the Avatar is within this range and leaves the range.  The message contains the avatar's name.
